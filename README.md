This is a school project assigned to me by my teacher. I didn't do it willingly :'). This uses hardcoded roll and registration number to manually fetch the result from Comilla Board's Official Website. Uses basic HTML parsing and some not so complex mathematical calculation. If anyone wants to use it, kindly change the hardcoded value to yours and make sure you're from Comilla Board. Peace :P
